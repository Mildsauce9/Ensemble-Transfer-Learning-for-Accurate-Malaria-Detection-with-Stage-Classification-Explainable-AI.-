Malaria is a mosquito borne disease that is very dangerous and spreads through air as well as the bite of a female Anopheles mosquito. This repository contains a novel approach to identify the presence of Malaria in a given blood sample as well as to identify the stage of malaria which is further explained using XAI (Explainable AI).
